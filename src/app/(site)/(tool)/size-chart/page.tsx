            Tattoo artists use inches to determine the total size of your desired body art. Depending on the chosen option, the tattooed area can be square, rectangle, or non-specific. Some artists calculate a total area to cover when discussing the price and other specifics with you.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Another thing to note is that big tattoo sizes might require multiple sessions. A single session takes about two hours. But if you and the artist can handle it, it can extend up to five hours.

          <h2 className="mt-15 text-2xl font-bold">2Ã—2 TATTOO SIZE</h2>
          <p className="mt-4">
          If you look at the tattoo size and time chart, this is a fine choice for most beginners. Itâ€™s not the smallest option available, so it gives enough room to convey the right message. If you have a single symbol, animal, or character, 2Ã—2 will be sufficient to show it proudly.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
          The experts recommend anything from hearts and other symbols to butterflies, birds, and other animals for a small tattoo. You can also pick initials and some minimalist designs. As for the placement, go with the ankles, or wrists, or lower arm, especially if you are a female.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-15 text-2xl font-bold">3Ã—3 TATTOO SIZE</h2>
          <p className="mt-4">
          This is a common option, and the crucial thing to note is that it significantly increases the total tattoo area. That gives you more room when choosing the placement of the 3Ã—3 tattoo. You can go with thighs or wrists, but also shoulders and upper arms. This size is sufficient enough for your chest and ribcage if those are your preferred body art options.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
          You can portray an animal protector or a mythological character with this size. A floral motive, but also swords, feathers, and similar shapes, can be a wise choice, too.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-15 text-2xl font-bold">4Ã—4 TATTOO SIZE</h2>
          <p className="mt-4">
          This range already enters large tattoo sizes. Not many people choose an actual square area, so the shape depends on the chosen tattoo. A dragon, tiger, or another powerful creator will look good in this size. You can go for cartoon and mythological characters, but also humans. If the stylist is skilled enough, they can even add some imagery around the focal point of the tattoo.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-15 text-2xl font-bold">6x6 TATTOO SIZE</h2>
          <p className="mt-4">
          Although there are larger tattoo sizes, this is the last one weâ€™ll mention. If itâ€™s your first piece, donâ€™t go bigger than this. 6Ã—6 tattoos look best on thighs, hips, shoulders, or the upper back. Itâ€™s also enough to get a half or full-sleeve, depending on your armâ€™s dimensions.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
          If you like large fonts and symbols, you can go with that. However, thereâ€™s no reason not to combine a mythical creature or character with some additional elements. Roses and skulls are a common combination for this tattoo size.
